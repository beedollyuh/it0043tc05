               <p class="name"> Finn
                <p class="race"> Human
                </p>
               </p>
            </div>
            <p class = "desc"> Although at times impulsive, aggressive and short tempered, Finn is a kind, brave, selfless, and righteous boy. His aspirations to become a great hero makes him somewhat of a moral sheriff in the Land of Ooo, as he is willing to help and protect any innocent person or creature. Finn has a very strong sense of responsibility and becomes upset when he is unable to help others. Due to this and being somewhat simple-minded, Finn often feels conflicted when it is unclear whether something is good or evil. </p>

               <p class="name"> Jake
                <p class="race"> Dog
                </p>
               </p>
            </div>
            <p> Jake is generally laid-back and tends not to worry about things. He relies heavily on his powers (or Finn) to get him out of any dangerous predicament. While he often cracks jokes at serious times, Jake always has a lecture or a song to cheer Finn up if he is feeling disheartened. He can be somewhat irresponsible at times, frequently leaving Finn to fight most of a battle on his own, but he always pulls through when he is needed most.</p>

               <p class="name"> Princess Bubblegum
                <p class="race"> Candy Elemental
                </p>
               </p>
            </div>
            <p class = "desc"> While Princess Bubblegum is typically kind, good-hearted and well-mannered, she can be very temperamental and has shown a malicious aspect of her personality whenever she is crossed. Even with her kind disposition, her moral code is not as strict as Finn's and there are also hints of a darker aspect of her personality. Bubblegum also adores the people of her kingdom and puts their safety above all else. In her dedication, she sometimes drives herself to exhaustion with her tasks. She is also a rational thinker with skepticism towards magic, labeling it as "scientific principles presented like mystical hoodoo."</p>

                </p>
               </p>
            </div>
            <p class = "desc">Having spent centuries traversing the Land of Ooo, she has evolved into a "fearless daredevil",[37] and her fondness for mischief has turned her into something of a trickster. She can also be sentimental. She was very emotionally attached to her teddy bear Hambo, which was given to her by Simon Petrikov.</p>

                </p>
               </p>
            </div>
            <p class = "desc">BMO is very protective of Finn and Jake. In "Incendium," BMO says, "If anyone tries to hurt Finn, I will kill them." In "Guardians of Sunshine," BMO refuses to let Finn and Jake enter the video game world saying, "No! It's a far too dangerous, incredible adventure for you! That's final!"</p>
